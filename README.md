# Bean Bot
Bean Bot is an economy bot that uses beans as currency. There is a jobs system to earn money and also fun mini-games to play with friends(if you have any that is).

## Jobs
You can take different jobs that are offered by the *Bean Society*. You can work once everyday and if you skip work for a day, you lose your streak. If you have a high enough streak you can take other jobs that pay more.

## Minigames
Some mini-games you can play:
1. Fighting
2. Gambling
3. Much more coming soon...

## Currency
Earning money is fun, stealing it is even more fun. But when you're stolen from it's not as fun. So you can deposit your beans to be kept safely inside your bank. You start with only 500 beans of bank storage, you can extend this by buying Bank Storage Coupons from the shop.

## Image Commands
Generate your own memes using the Image commands. Making memes with Bean Bot is statiscally proven to get more updoots on Reddit, just saying...

## Shop
Speaking of buying from the shops, you can buy a variety of items from the shop that can do different things.
